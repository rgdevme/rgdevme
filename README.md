Quick run down of it:

- It's made with Notion as a DB, and Next.js for the UI.
- It uses Vercel and Github Pages for deployment (just for fun).
- It's statically generated, for excelent speed and SEO (it's also very small).
- It was build in about a week or so.
- It includes al the info you'll need about me.
